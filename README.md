How to Run the ML Backend for React Native
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies: Note: We specifically use tensorflow<2.16 to ensure compatibility with the .h5 model format (Keras 2), as newer versions (Keras 3) may fail to load older models.
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/bMac
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running Locally
Run the Flask server:

python app.py
This will start the server on http://0.0.0.0:5000.

Connecting from React Native
Option 1: Android Emulator
Use the special IP address 10.0.2.2 to access your local machine.

URL: http://10.0.2.2:5000/predict
Option 2: iOS Simulator
Use localhost.

URL: http://localhost:5000/predict
Option 3: Physical Device (Same Network)
Find your computer's local IP address (e.g., run ifconfig or check network settings).

URL: http://<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>:5000/predict
Ensure your firewall allows incoming connections on port 5000.
Option 4: Tunneling (Using npx - Recommended)
If you have Node.js installed (typical for React Native), use localtunnel without installing extra software.

Run your Flask server: python app.py
In a new terminal:
npx localtunnel --port 5000
Copy the URL (e.g., https://funny-cat-42.loca.lt) and use it in your app.
Option 5: Tunneling (Using ngrok)
Install ngrok.
Run ngrok http 5000.
Use the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok.
API Usage
Endpoint: /predict
Method: POST
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body:
file: The image file you want to predict.
Example fetch in React Native:

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("file", {
    uri: imageUri, // file path from image picker
    type: "image/jpeg",
    name: "upload.jpg",
});

const response = await fetch("http://YOUR_IP:5000/predict", {
    method: "POST",
    body: formData,
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data",
    },
});
const result = await response.json();
console.log(result);
Cloud Hosting (Production)
Deploy on Render (Recommended)
Render offers a generous free tier that should work for this project.

Push to GitHub: Ensure this code is in a GitHub repository. Make sure plant_disease_model.h5 and disease_info(1).csv are committed or available.

Sign up for Render: Go to render.com and sign in with GitHub.

Create New Web Service:

Click "New +" -> "Web Service".
Connect your repository.
Configure Service:

Name: plant-disease-api (or similar)
Region: Choose closest to you.
Branch: main (or your default branch)
Runtime: Python 3
Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command: gunicorn app:app
Deploy:

Click "Create Web Service".
Wait for the build to finish. Once you see "Your service is live", copy the URL (e.g., https://plant-disease-api.onrender.com).
Update React Native App:

Replace your localhost or localtunnel URL with this new production URL.
Note on Free Tier:

The free tier spins down after inactivity. The first request might take ~50 seconds to wake up.
Tensorflow is a large library. If the build fails due to memory/slug size limits, consider using a smaller ML library or a paid instance, but for simple school projects, it usually fits if optimized.
Option: Deploy with Docker (via Registry)
If you prefer to build the image locally and push it to a registry (like Docker Hub), follow these steps:

Configure Makefile: Open the Makefile and change REGISTRY_USER = codepraycode to your Docker Hub username.

Login & Push:

docker login
make all  # Builds, tags, and pushes to Docker Hub
Run Locally (Optional):

make run
Deploy on Render:

Go to Render Dashboard -> New + -> Web Service.
Select "Deploy an existing image from a registry".
Enter your image URL: docker.io/YOUR_USERNAME/plant-disease-api:latest.
Click Next -> Create Web Service.
